(of course, all of this relies on hardware support for disks/mmc)
main file system
database-like, key-value store
  keys are symbols (at least logically, probably strings on disk)
  values are arbitrary objects
everything is in it: code, text documents, spreadsheets, images, videos (eww), pdfs (ewwwww)
serialization is transparent and generic

there must be a way to interface with at least fat filesystems, others would be nice, too
  it might actually be better to do FAT first, because then we can modify the uboot partition
  actually, all hierarchical file systems should be a similar interface

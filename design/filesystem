(of course, all of this relies on hardware support for disks/mmc)
main file system
object database
  can iterate over all of a type in the database
    should be a standard way to filter the results
  should also be a link between nodes (but that's harder)
everything is in it: code, text documents, spreadsheets, images, videos (eww), pdfs (ewwwww)
serialization is transparent and generic (once you include the mix-in)
  should saving be explicit? there are arguments both ways

there must be a way to interface with at least fat filesystems, others would be nice, too
  it might actually be better to do FAT first, because then we can modify the uboot partition
  actually, all hierarchical file systems should be a similar interface
